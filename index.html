      <p>Made tweaks to the Receipt app and am looking for a new name.</p>
      <p>With so much movement on AutoGPT, I took a look through the code changes and retried some of the tasks I had
        written. The first task was to research a consumer product, and this one had no luck at all. AutoGPT can now
        correct itself when something in the scripting causes errors, but it never completed its research and provided
        results before getting stuck in a loop.</p>
      <p>But I had what I thought a more difficult task of determining cloud infrastructure and creating configuration
        based on loose requirements. I spent $0.26 and I wonder if I could have gotten farther by spending a bit more.
        AutoGPT does not feel efficient, but it does feel like it can make progress given enough time and resources.
        This has me more optimistic than the last time I tried, all of 4 days ago.

      <div class="project-title">AGI - AutoGPT</div>
      <p>I tried out the AutoGPT project, an experimental set of scripts that create a series of steps to complete a
        given task and reach a goal. It's a very interesting concept, but it tends to run in circles even with the GPT-4
        API. However, there's a lot of potential here.</p>

      <div class="project-title">GPT Amusing Delusions</div>
      <p>I spent some time today dealing with GPT's hallucinations. Since my app project has a few pages (I'm not
        interested in building it as a Single Page Application), I used GPT to help me implement a templating/layout
        engine.</p>
      <p>Since I already know better than to follow GPT too deep into a rabbit hole, I had to point out that its
        suggestion was specifically mentioned as unsupported in the library's documentation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <div class="project-date">2023-04-05</div>
      <div class="project-title">Cloudflare Pages & Workers</div>
      <p>GPT and I decided to build an app for receipt splitting for group orders. The idea is to scan the receipt,
        generate a unique URL to email or SMS the group, and then allow each person to select their items from an
        itemized receipt. The app will also create a quick link to Venmo the owed amount to the person who paid the
        bill.</p>
      <p>After some discussion, GPT and I chose to use Cloudflare Pages & Workers, partly because I wanted to try it.
        GPT created the home page, which is a form to add a scanned receipt, the tip amount, and the user's Venmo
        address.</p>
      <p>The Cloudflare worker uses the Google Vision API for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and GPT created
        parser logic to process the resulting OCR blocks into line items. Although GPT-4's image model might be able to
        do this more efficiently out of the box, I was astounded by how GPT-4 coded up a solution in seconds that only
        needed minor tweaks, like adjusting thresholds for items being on the same line.</p>
      <p>We made amazing progress in a short amount of time, but the project is not finished yet.</p>

      <div class="project-title">MidJourney Describe</div>
      <p>I used MidJourney Describe to recreate isometric vector graphics and more. Additionally, I used the GPT code
        interpreter to remove the border from the planet in the favicon. To my amusement, it worked! I initially thought
        it wasn't functioning properly, but it turned out that the image previewer within VS Code wasn't displaying the
        image correctly.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <div class="project-date">2023-04-03</div>
      <div class="project-title">MidJourney</div>
      <p>I used MidJourney for prompting icons, logos, and a new background image. Utilizing the moon from the generated
        art, I employed MidJourney's /describe feature to create some other moons in a similar style. I selected one and
        provided it to GPT's code interpreter to convert it into a favicon.</p>

        contextual knowledge in the vector store for later retrieval.</p>

      <div class="project-date">2023-03-30</div>
      <div class="project-title">More Vectors</div>
      <p>I added the company knowledge base as vectors to Pinecone and gave the Slack Bot access. I used my access to
        the GPT Code Interpreter to help build an XML Document Loader that includes metadata with links to the knowledge
        base sources. As it turns out, LangChain offers Notion document loaders for both markdown exported format and
        API, so I can use those if or when I rebuild the vectors.</p>

      <div class="project-date">2023-03-28/29</div>
      <div class="project-title">Slack Bot, Enhance</div>
      <p>I added the ability for the Slack Bot to answer questions related to the company's Notion. This feature uses
        Pinecone as a vector database, and LangChain AI libraries for loading data into vectors, querying vectors, and
        prompting GPT-3.</p>

        it create a prompt for MidJourney to generate a tattoo design.</p>

      <p>I converted Voice AI to a cross-platform app using Flutter. The Whisper API was just an experiment, so this
        time I went with on-device voice transcription. I compiled the app for Android, iOS, and macOS.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <div class="project-date">2023-03-17</div>
      <div class="project-title">Voice AI</div>
      <p>Using Android Studio, I built an Android widget to record audio, send it to the OpenAI Whisper API for
        transcription, and then send it to the GPT-3 API for summarization. The widget initiated the share/email flow to
        send the summary in an email, save it to notes, etc.</p>
      <p>Due to limitations widgets have when recording audio, I rebuilt the app without the widget.</p>
